# MusicTransfer-API

This is the desktop counterpart for https://github.com/jault3/MusicTransfer. You must run this application before you can run that application on your iOS device. 

To run this applcatin clone to repo. Open up terminal and navigate to the root of the project. Run `./gradlew run`. As long as that terminal window is open the program will be running. To stop the program from running while in terminal, hit `ctrl`-`c`.

Any music that is transfered to your computer is saved in the root of the project inside of the `filesDir` folder. You can then use the files however you'd like, obeying any copyright laws of course.
